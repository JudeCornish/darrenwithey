                        <p class="company-statement">"I've had the pleasure of knowing Darren for over 5 years now, he is authentic and genuine, both On- and Off-court.  

                            On Squash itself, both my son and I enjoyed the enthusiasm and energy Darren brought to every session.  He always had a plan from lessons focused on technique, to pressure situations and simulated match play.
                            
                            Darren is a coach who will work constructively and patiently with his students who will benefit from his substantial experience and squash skills."

                        <p class="company-statement">"He took me on as a distinctly awkward beginner aged 14, and over the following years coached me to a top ten U19 ranking, playing No1 for the University of Bath and most recently leading the British Army Ladies team.  More importantly, he imparted lots of ‘off court’ lessons about the value of hard work, fun, dedication and family, along with a love of the game that will stay with me for life.  For that, I owe him a great debt.  If Darren is still coaching when I have kids - they won’t be going anywhere else!"</p>

                        <p class="company-statement">"Darren Withey was one of the most inspirational coaches I ever had the pleasure of working with. From gruelling drills, to fun games, to 24 hour squashathons - he encouraged, coached and drilled me from complete novice to county level squash. He always pushed me to challenge my limits but never too hard, and the sturdy foundations I developed with him formed the structure for my game as it developed through my university career - competing in the BUCS premier league.

                            <br><br>Through his teaching, I incorporated new elements into my game. I owe this man a debt of gratitude for developing my love of squash, and recommend him in the highest degree possible as a coach, no matter what level you are."</p>

                        <p class="company-statement">"His patience, lifetime of experience, ability to analyse and improve specific technical issues and all round love for the game make it great. I played to a high league standard in my 20s and have come back to it in my 40s. Over the last 2 years Darren has brought my game back to a decent level but so much fitter and stronger. All this done with great professionalism and motivation but good humour too. There is no substitute for experience like this, whatever your level."</p>

                        <p class="company-statement">"I have been hugely impressed with the effect Darren has had on both my children, but particularly my youngest Billy. Before joining the school Billy had never played squash. His progress since then has been astonishing due to his dedication of course, but also in no small part to the encouragement and guidance he has received from Darren. He has been inspirational to Billy who has responded accordingly. This coaching has been based on both technical and tactical aspects of the game but also by instilling the importance of hard work and applying a growth mindset. The atmosphere around the courts is one of positively and progression, and it is no coincidence that he consistently produces players and teams who compete successfully with schools possessing much greater resources."</p>

                        <p class="company-statement">"I've know Darren both as a fellow player, a coach and a friend through his work in Bucks, and more recently via Chesham Bois Squash Club and Aylesbury Grammar School.

                            As with most let's call it more mature players my fitness has never been my strongest point. Darren's pressure sessions are by far the most valuable part of the workouts we do. His knowledge and experience in knowing how to extract the maximum out of me means I get the most out of every session.
                            
                            Off the court Darren is both friendly and likable, and is always prepared to be flexible with session times. This fits in perfectly with my somewhat hectic lifestyle. The fact that he knows what it takes to still be competing at a very high level makes him both an inspiration as well and a leader who one can follow."</p>

                        <p class="company-statement">"I think Mr Withey is a good coach because he is very observant of your style and how you play. As well as having lots of knowledge of the game. He also makes it makes it more fun and engaging than other coaches."</p>

                        <p class="company-statement">"Darren was my first squash coach and I had coaching from him for years. I must have met him when I was around 8. I remember how comfortable I felt straight away when usually I would be nervous. He put me at ease and we had so much fun in our sessions but also I improved a great deal.<br><br>Darren's vast experience and high level of coaching coupled with his friendly and personable nature makes for such a wonderful experience from his coaching no matter your level or age. He was the perfect fit for me and I highly recommend him.

<br><br>I went on to represent my country at a junior level and then to play on the professional world tour and reach a ranking of 220 in the world.

I'll always be grateful to Darren for starting me off along the right path with my squash. Thanks Darren!"</p>

                        <p class="company-statement">"I was coached by Darren for around 2 and a half years before I moved to America. The years while I was coached by Darren were great. I improved a lot while being coached by Darren. He helped me reach very high in the national ranking such as top 5 in the UK. He taught me so many new things that helped on and off court, some of the things I have taken away from being coached by Darren which I still use till today is that I have learnt to always look for the volleys, I have learnt how to train before a tournament, I have learnt what to do physically and mentally during a tournament, and one more thing I have learnt from Darren is I now know how to prevent injuries and how to keep my body fit at all times. With all this being said, being coached by Darren was an amazing experience and was one I will never forget."</p>

I have seen him not just Improving Squash but changing lives of the players. "</p>
